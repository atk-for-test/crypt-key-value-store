The FileContent struct isn't stored anywhere (or that the design doc doesn't mention where they will store it). Assuming that they store in differently from User struct, they will be fine.

\section{Summary}
For improving AppendFile, you may change your FilePtr struct to the last Part Number of a file. 
You had to consider the case that your program may be stopped, and that values stored in variables will get lost on re-run. So, all data needs to be stored in DataStore. Rest of the design is fine, and shall work well when implemented.
